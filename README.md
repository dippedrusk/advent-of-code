# Advent of Code 2020 solutions

Time constraints and other commitments mean that this will mostly all be in Python. You probably
shouldn't try to learn too much from this code since there is a lot that's msising - including
but not limited to automated tests, linting, input validation, data sanitization, bounds checking,
exception handling, etc.

I am also prioritizing a solution that works over a solution that is efficient, so do not be
shocked at the triple loop in `day1.py`. I'm doing this because I love puzzles and I love coding
and so this is fun!

This is my first year doing Advent of Code but if the first two puzzles are any indication of what
the rest of this is going to look like, you'll see two files for every day of the advent calendar:
`2020day${x}input` (the input data) and `day${x}.py` (the code for my solution).
